scripts
=======

Place to keep all of my useful scripts

import-macports.pl
========

This script has been moved - it now lives in my 'munkiports' repo at https://github.com/48kRAM/munkiports


publish-cups-dns
================

This is a cleaned-up version of the script I use at work to publish printer information into wide-area DNS-SD (DNS service discovery - a.k.a. "bonjour")
